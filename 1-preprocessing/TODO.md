# TODO

- Result consistency: set rng seed
+ Pearson Correlation matrix (rejest > 0.8 linear correlations)
+ Selection of currency sets (n -> 1 forecasting)
+ Selection of exchange rate predictors and targets (lowest linear correlation)
+ How many predictors should be selected? (5)
+ What offsets should be applied to the predictors? (a single time lag for all)
+ Single split: only training and test set (split of training set for cross-validation done via scikit-learn GridSearchCV))

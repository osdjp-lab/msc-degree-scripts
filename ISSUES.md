# Issues

## Prediction methodology

- Based on test set predictor values (iterative)
- Based on initial test set predictor set of values followed by the models generated result for consecutive values

## Potential issues

- Model performance better on test set than training set
- Too large dataset (use subset) [no effect]
- Unsuitable exchange rate predictors

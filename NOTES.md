# Notes

## Potential routes of inquiry

+ Use other forecast evaluation metrics (R2 sensitive to outliers) - MSE, RMSE, MAE
+ Evaluate models forecasting performance on the training dataset
+ Data without stationarization
+ Log transformation, Winsoring or Box-Cox transformation of the data
- Use baseline models: ARIMA, random walk
- Cointegration
- Regularization (L1, L2, dropout, early stopping)
